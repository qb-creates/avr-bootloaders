# AVR Bootloaders
This repository contains a collection of individual bootloader projects, each designed for a specific AVR microcontroller part number. These bootloaders are compatible with the qbdude tool for seamless program uploads. Get the latest release of QB.DUDE <a href="https://github.com/qb-creates/qbdude">here</a>

## Communication
The communication for these bootloaders is done over USART. Ensure that your microcontroller is connected to the appropriate USART interface for seamless bootloader operation.
